A way to avoid the CORS-Extension:

Add the following to your node application which handles the requests:

app.use(function(req, res, next) {
            res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
            res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE');
            res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');

            // intercept OPTIONS method
            if ('OPTIONS' == req.method) {
              res.send(200);
            } else {
              req.db = db;
              next();
            }
        }
);
