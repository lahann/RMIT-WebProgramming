Assignment 1:

/dist - Directory
    - For easier deployment we wanted only a few files
    - We added a new script in package.json, 'build'. Webpack then compress our whole code into the 'bundle.js' file
    - We updated the webpack.config.js so that the local server knows where to find the sources
    - https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/

/src - Directory
    - Contains our sourcecode
    - Code splitted into more directories because of the clarity and to provide a 'real-life-project' structure

/admin-site - Directory
    - 

/checkout-site - Directory
    - only place to edit quantity and remove selected items
    - if you click 'add to cart' on the same product more than once in the product-overview or product-detail page, 
    the quantity of that product is still 1 in your shopping cart
    - cart resets once submitted 

/components - Directory
    - Our basic components
    - What to we want to display
    - 'Constants.jsx' - Single point for the used strings/ actions

/containers - Directory
    - Our functionality
    - How do we want to 
    
/images - Directory
    - Contains the images we use in our application
    - The three GitHub images for the About Us-Page
    - cropped-logo.png as placeholder in case a product provides no imageUrl

.gitignore - File
    - Things (files/ directories) we do not want to have in our GIT Repository

package.json - File
    - Configuration of our dependencies
    - 'react-bootstrap' - Display our content more beautiful
    - 'react-router-dom' - Simply routing with boilerplate components
        - Therefore we implemented the 'Root.jsx'-Component
        - https://medium.com/@pshrmn/a-simple-react-router-v4-tutorial-7f23ff27adf
    - 'react-tooltip' - Easy tooltip for our products
    - 'redux-devtools-extension' - Chrome Plugin to have an overview on the actual state/ the invoked actions

webpack.config.js - File
    - Webpack configuration file
    - 'output' to specify our bundled filename and the path where to find it
    - 'file-loader'/ 'image-webpack-loader' to load images


Assignment 2:

\admin-site\actions\index.js - Admin actions
    - Naming of fetchOrders() / updateOrder() - We don't have a own collection for the orders, 
        instead we put the order status inside of the shopping cart, 
        therefore we fetch from the shopping cart collection
        and we only update the order status, not the customer or the products in the shopping cart
    - Click on an order ID to view its details (customer info and products)
